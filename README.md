Hello, my name is "Katy." I don't know how to code, or much about coding, but I'm excited to learn what this class can provide me with. Currently, I'm in high school and am involved with Mock Trial. I like mock trial. I'm a pre-trial defense attorney meaning I use a "defendants" constitutional rights to defend them and convince a judge that certain evidence should not be allowed during the trial. 
Other than that, I'm also really invested with the American Red Cross. The joy I receive from helping others is inexplicable. Service projects, bloods drives, and CPR training are all a part of what I parttake in.
